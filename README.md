# GodotFleshAndBloodPackSimulator

An application to help with running a Flesh and Blood Progression Series!

****Flesh and Blood Progression Series Guidelines****


**About**


A progression series is a way to run a series of games for a TCG based off of Cimoooooooo and Nyhmnim’s Progression series of videos for the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading card game. 


The main premise is that you progress through the history of the game, set by set, opening packs and building decks based off of all the cards you have acquired so far.


This series is meant to be for fun, and there are a variety of rules and weekly wrenches you can and should throw into the mix to make it more exciting.


**Format**


The series will be played in an Open Blitz format with the following rules:

1 young hero card

52 card-pool (includes weapons, equipment, etc., and cards in the deck)

Start with exactly 40 cards in the deck

Up to 3 copies of each unique card

35 minutes per round, best of 1

Players will build their decks by cracking one box (usually 24 packs) of the current set, adding it to their total cardpool for the series and then building their deck from that pool of available cards.

We are allowing 3 copies of each unique card since the power-level should be lower and it may be hard to build a 40-card deck with only 2 copies of each card available. Especially for weeks where you may want to limit the cardpool to only that set.

We would normally recommend running a round-robin tournament every set, so that everyone can see everyone’s decks and the bannings are less targeted. But anything works, just need to determine the winners and losers:


**Winners and Losers**


Each set you play you should host a tournament or league that will determine the winners and losers of that week.

The winners of a week typically get some sort of bonus, we will do one extra pack of the next set to be opened.

The losers of the week typically get some sort of bonus as well, we will do one extra pack of the previous set and a ban.


**Bans**


Players who lose in a week will be able to ban one card from the cardpool for the remainder of the series. We will not differentiate cards based on colour for the purposes of banning. So if Pummel gets banned, you cannot play Pummel (red), Pummel (blue) or Pummel (yellow) for the remainder of the series. 

We will not allow banning heroes at this time as a test, instead they will follow a format like LSS uses for LL’ing them (but with a more basic system).


**LL’ing Heroes**


There will have to be different systems in place for the different formats the tournaments or leagues can take. 


Heroes will be banned for the remainder of the series when they accrue 10 points, they will accrue points as follows, for each player playing them that week:
3 wins and 0 losses : 5 points
2 wins and 1 loss : 3 points
1 win and 2 losses - 1 point
0 wins - 0 points


**Tokens**


All tokens and not-draft friendly cards should be made available to players up to the current set. This includes young heroes, heroes (for CC weeks) and their weapons.. 

To facilitate this, there is a toggle switch on pack open to include 3 of every token to your binder on save.


**Wheel sets**


This is a way to spice up the current format, you can do a wheel week whenever you want to (but they’re good for supplemental or reprint sets). In a wheel set you will spin a randomized wheel and apply the ruleset it lands on for that set’s deckbuild and games.
Example wheel ideas:
Classic Constructed (Old Heroes, 60 card decks)
Project Blue ( Rares and Commons only )
No Card Limits ( Can run as many of a card as you pulled )
Master Chef (Randomly pick a set of 10-20 cards from across FaBs total card pool, players must use some/all of them)
Singleton (1 copy of each card only in the decks)
Better not fatigue (20 card decks)
